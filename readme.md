# Phoenix-OpenBook Smart Trade
In Solana's DEFI ecosystem, two CLOB exchanges, OpenBook and Phoenix, have garnered community interest, with many AMMs integrating these two exchanges into their systems.

Both have demonstrated Solana's exceptional capability to deploy DEX exchanges with similar features to CEX exchanges: speed, stability, and efficiency.

OpenBook and Phoenix are considered cornerstones in the Solana DEFI system.
